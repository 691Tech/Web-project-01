🚛 LoadsoR - Comprehensive Logistics Platform UI/UX
⭐ Impressive Project Introduction
This project, LoadsoR, serves as a robust and visually compelling User Interface prototype for a modern, all-in-one logistics management platform. Designed and developed as a Final Year Project at Parul University, LoadsoR addresses the complexity of the transport industry by offering a simplified, single-dashboard experience for all stakeholders—Shippers, Transporters, Fleet Owners, and Brokers. This application showcases high-fidelity UI/UX design, mobile responsiveness, and dynamic multi-page navigation entirely built using production-ready front-end technologies. It is a testament to the ability to translate complex functional requirements into an intuitive and effective digital solution.
👩‍🎓 Project Details
This project is titled LoadsoR - Logistics Platform UI/UX Prototype and was created by Sristy Sinha as a Final Year Project / Web Application Design at Parul University. The current status of the project is Prototype / UI Development Complete.
✨ Key Features Implemented
The application is built to simulate a full user journey within the logistics domain, featuring the following pages and functionalities:
Multi-Role Sign-Up Flow (Landing Page):
A dedicated landing view is present to onboard users based on their roles, which include Customer/Shipper, Transporter/Booking Agent, Truck Operator/Fleet Owner, and Broker/Truck Supplier. Each role is presented with a distinct and appealing card for selection.
Detailed Registration Modals:
The prototype includes four dedicated registration forms (modals) for each user type. These forms collect all necessary basic, contact, and company details as per the provided wireframes. It also includes validation placeholders for critical information such as mobile number, email, GST number, and PAN number.
Sign In & Authentication Simulation:
The Sign In view is fully functional, accepting Mobile Number and Password. A Forgot Password link is included, which triggers a Reset Password Modal. Additionally, a simulated QR Code Login section provides a modern login alternative. The Functional Login/Logout feature successfully simulates authentication, redirecting the user to the dashboard upon "Sign In" and back to the login page upon "Logout."
Dashboard Simulation:
A comprehensive post-login view (/dashboard) is provided. This dashboard showcases key performance indicators (KPIs) like Active Loads, Completed Shipments, and Pending Payments, demonstrating a clear, professional layout suitable for daily logistics operations.
Full Responsiveness:
The entire application design is fully adaptive, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
🛠️ Technology Stack
This project was developed using a lean, powerful, and industry-standard front-end stack:
HTML5: Used for the foundational structure and content organization of the application.
JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Implemented for core application logic, managing view switching, and handling all modal interactions and form submission simulations.
Tailwind CSS (via CDN): Utilized for rapid and fully responsive utility-first styling, ensuring modern design aesthetics and consistency across all views.
Lucide Icons: Integrated for all visual icons used across the navigation bar and feature lists.
🚀 How to Run the Project
Since this is a single, self-contained HTML file, running the project is extremely simple:
Download: Save the provided code into a file named index.html.
Run: Double-click the index.html file. It will automatically open in your default web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
Interact: You can now use the "Sign In" and "Free Sign Up" buttons to navigate between the main views and test the modal forms. The "Sign In" button will automatically log you in and take you to the Dashboard.
